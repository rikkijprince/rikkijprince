- 👋 Hi, I’m Rikki J Prince, author of the Sarah Mackay saga and many other works.
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, the natural sciences (especially physics), technology, cosmmology, philosophy, and psychology.
      Also scientific aspects of the occult and last, but not least, sexology.
- 🌱 I’m currently writing and actively on all these topics, and looking for readers who share my interests.
- 💞️ I’m open to AI ghostwriting projects, and willing to help companies create their own AI agents.
